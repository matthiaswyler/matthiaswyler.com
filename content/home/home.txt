Based in Zurich, I am an designer dedicated to collaborating with enthusiastic individuals, artists, publishers, and institutions.

My practice is defined by a rigorous, typographic approach, encompassing book design, visual identities, websites, and other printed materials. In 2014, I co-founded Studio Sirup with Andr√© Rothfuchs, and together we launched the publishing house (link: https://sugus.press text:Sugus Press).
