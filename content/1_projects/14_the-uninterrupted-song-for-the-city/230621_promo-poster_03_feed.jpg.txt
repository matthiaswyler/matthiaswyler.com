Alt: Poster for "The Uninterrupted Song for the City" mounted on a poster stand, surrounded by bicycles in a concrete urban setting. Blurred figures and reflective surfaces suggest movement and an urban environment. The poster appears to be a graphic design or event announcement with a minimalist black and white design.
