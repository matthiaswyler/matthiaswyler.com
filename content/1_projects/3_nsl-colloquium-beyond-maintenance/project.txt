The typeface dances between legible and playful, formal and loose, mirroring the event's core themes. Text becomes more than information; it's a visual landscape of its own.</p><p>Communication materials where typography doesn't just tell, it shows. The design embodies the responsive, fluid thinking at the heart of the colloquium, challenging viewers to see how form and function can bend and breathe together.</p>"},"id":"afd56b6b-0727-4ade-a4b2-38d5b0f8c428","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":[],"id":"7381db43-6048-44c3-a264-95ac47e14f22","isHidden":false,"type":"line"}],"id":"b3b63828-bfea-4d77-a76e-386676c2ccc6","width":"2/3"},{"blocks":[],"id":"a542fc6a-0f42-40db-9a75-920c59ea2e89","width":"1/3"}],"id":"f8ed8164-3487-4f99-9425-74720cda04cd"},{"attrs":{"class":""},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://iyV9HGhzfwu2WwGS"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Tree shapes as a Inspiration.","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"05aa2303-4435-4be1-8f4c-390425117f1e","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"1da1751b-8562-4d12-8b12-672af608ddd5","width":"1/4"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://WEXSy4yoxZo7YvRU"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Maintenance, reservation, conservation, continuation:<br>- What is the relationship between the arrangements for \"working on\" and the arrangements for \"living\"? <br>- What is the relation in the plan between maintain and consumption?","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"3ee0497c-763e-40c1-a5b2-0d9853351b61","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"2c21e681-9c1c-45e4-b31f-57e93fccc77f","width":"1/4"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://Xl4wD0p7oOLAxcT7"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"The typography evolves from crisp and formal to abstract and wild, shifting in and out of focus like the landscapes themselves.
