## What I'm doing now

Updated December 2025, from my atelier on Langstrasse in Zürich.

## Almost Christmas, almost no winter

It's nearly Christmas but the winters keep getting warmer. Walking to work through Seefeld, it feels strange – no snow, just mild grey days. The kids don't seem to mind though. They're buzzing with excitement about the holidays.

## Reading Adichie

Currently reading [*Dream Count* by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie](https://www.amazon.com/Dream-Count-Chimamanda-Ngozi-Adichie/dp/0593802721). Her clarity cuts through everything.

## Publishing web projects

Launching several client websites – architecture firms, cultural institutions, the usual mix. Each one built with Kirby CMS, everything multilingual, everything accessible. That sweet spot where design and code meet is where I live.
