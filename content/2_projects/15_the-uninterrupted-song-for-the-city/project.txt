This initiative challenges conventional narratives and ethics surrounding museums and their colonial-era collections. The project, positioned as part of the broader \"The Improbable Memorial\" series, aims to reconstruct dreams, possibilities, and awareness within the music industry and beyond.</p><p>The project explores the ethical implications of museums archiving relics acquired through colonial expeditions. It raises critical questions about the role of museums in preserving the heritage of those whose ancestors were imperiled by colonialism. Through innovative methods of knowledge production and potential history-telling, the project delves into the complexities of these archival practices.</p>"},"id":"d432cbd2-6b12-4765-9453-6d212ff3a66e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":[],"id":"4cfb9ea6-28a2-4eb8-9158-4ff19ef96e11","isHidden":false,"type":"line"}],"id":"d9940149-47ae-41b5-8afb-f3c5f04048d2","width":"2/3"},{"blocks":[],"id":"54c97bb1-b70e-421a-86d8-21212fc636d1","width":"1/3"}],"id":"d37d0196-b017-4e31-a7cb-7ba21ce0fafa"},{"attrs":{"class":""},"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://3oqauVhiiWVrhQ0v"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"f0fc84b3-6d52-4f5a-a995-04c62f96f38b","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}],"id":"bc8a1a80-4965-4b97-8edb-bbdc0580a1e8","width":"1/4"},{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://vK31UyZGzvORPhFe"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Using the soundscape of Kinshasa as a musical instrument, the project incorporates sounds from street hawkers, offbeat melodies from carpenters, churches, and parties.
